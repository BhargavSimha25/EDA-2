# Encoding, Feature Selection, and Feature Engineering in Machine Learning 🔧

Welcome to the **Encoding, Feature Selection, and Feature Engineering** repository! This project offers resources and tools for mastering essential techniques in preparing and optimizing data for machine learning models. Proper data preparation is crucial for building effective models and making accurate predictions.

## 📚 Overview

Data preparation involves encoding categorical variables, selecting relevant features, and engineering new features to improve model performance. This repository provides guidance and practical examples for each of these critical steps in the data preprocessing pipeline.

## 📖 Contents

### 1. **Encoding** 🔠
   - **One-Hot Encoding:** Convert categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning models by creating binary columns for each category.
   - **Label Encoding:** Assign unique integer values to categorical variables to facilitate their use in algorithms.
   - **Ordinal Encoding:** Handle categorical features with an inherent order by encoding them into ordered integers.

### 2. **Feature Selection** 🔍
   - **Filter Methods:** Use statistical techniques like correlation coefficients and chi-square tests to select relevant features.
   - **Wrapper Methods:** Apply algorithms such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to iteratively select features based on model performance.
   - **Embedded Methods:** Leverage models that perform feature selection as part of the training process, such as Lasso Regression or Tree-based methods.

### 3. **Feature Engineering** 🛠️
   - **Creating New Features:** Generate new features from existing data, such as polynomial features or interaction terms, to enhance model complexity.
   - **Feature Scaling:** Normalize or standardize features to ensure they contribute equally to model training.
   - **Feature Extraction:** Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and extract important features from raw data.
