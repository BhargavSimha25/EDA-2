# EDA-2: Encoding, Feature Selection, and Feature Engineering
Welcome to the EDA-2 repository! This project provides in-depth resources and tutorials on advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA), focusing on encoding techniques, feature selection methods, and feature engineering, with a special emphasis on using Predictive Power Score (PPS) for feature selection.

### Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data science process. This repository delves into advanced EDA techniques, particularly encoding categorical variables, selecting relevant features, and engineering new features to improve model performance. The use of Predictive Power Score (PPS) as a method for feature selection is highlighted, offering a more robust alternative to traditional correlation metrics.

### Topics Covered
This repository includes detailed explanations and examples on the following topics:

Encoding Techniques: Various methods for converting categorical variables into numerical format, such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, and target encoding.
Feature Selection: Strategies for identifying the most important features, including filter methods, wrapper methods, and the use of PPS to assess feature importance.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to enhance predictive models, with examples of domain-specific feature engineering.
Predictive Power Score (PPS): Introduction to PPS, a technique for identifying non-linear relationships between variables and selecting features that contribute most to the target variable.
